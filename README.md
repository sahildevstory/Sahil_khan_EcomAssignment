1. Project Overview
This project is a modern e-commerce product listing application built with React and TypeScript that showcases products fetched from the FakeStore API.
The goal is to create a premium shopping experience with features such as search, category filtering, sorting, responsive design, and interactive UI elements.

2. Methodology
2.1 Planning & Requirements Gathering
Identified core features: product listing, search, filtering, sorting, responsive layout.

Chose modern, performant tech stack:

React 18 (component-based architecture, fast rendering)

TypeScript (type safety)

Vite (fast development/build)

Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

Lucide React (icons)

API Source: FakeStore API for realistic product data.

2.2 Architecture Design
Folder Structure:

src/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/           # Helper functions
└── App.tsx          # Main application component
Data Flow:

App.tsx manages global states: search, filters, sorting.

useProducts Hook fetches API data and handles loading/error states.

Utility functions filter, sort, and categorize data.

UI Components render processed data interactively.

2.3 Implementation
Data Management
useProducts.ts: Custom hook for fetching & managing product data.

Product.ts: TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

productUtils.ts: Filtering and sorting helpers.

UI Components
ProductCard: Displays product details with ratings & prices.

SearchBar: Real-time product filtering by title.

CategoryFilter: Auto-generated categories from API data.

SortOptions: Multiple sorting criteria.

LoadingSkeleton: Smooth animated placeholders.

ErrorState: Friendly error messages with retry.

2.4 Features Implemented
Core Functionalities:

Fetches 20 products from API.

Real-time search.

Dynamic category filtering.

Sorting by name, price, and rating.

Responsive design (mobile-first).

Enhanced UX:

Loading animations.

Hover effects & micro-interactions.

Product counts & active filter indicators.

2.5 Design System
Colors: Gradient-based palette (blues, purples, pinks).

Typography: Inter font, clear hierarchy.

Spacing: 8px grid system.

Shadows & Effects: Soft shadows, rounded corners, blur effects.

Animations: Smooth transitions & hover effects.

2.6 Responsive Behavior
Mobile (<640px): Single column, stacked filters.

Tablet (640px–1024px): Two columns, horizontal filters.

Desktop (>1024px): Four columns, full features.

Maintains max-width for readability on large screens.

2.7 Performance Optimizations
useMemo for expensive operations.

Conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Lazy image loading.

Hardware-accelerated transitions.

3. Screenshots
(Insert annotated screenshots showing each stage: Homepage, search in action, category filter applied, sorting applied, mobile view, loading state, error state)

4. Conclusion
This project showcases modern React development practices, a clean architecture, and a focus on UX/UI design.
It can be extended with features like:

Shopping cart functionality.

User authentication.

Checkout flow.
